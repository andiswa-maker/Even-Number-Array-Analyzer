1. Even Number Array Analyzer (C++)

2. Overview
This C++ program accepts 10 even numbers from the user. It validates that only even numbers are entered, sorts the numbers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm, calculates the average, and determines the highest value.

3. Features
. Input validation (only even numbers allowed)
. Array population
. Bubble sort (ascending order)
. Average calculation
. Highest value detection using pass-by-reference
. Formatted output using iomanip

4. Concepts Demonstrated
. Functions
. Arrays
. Loops
. Conditional statements
. Input validation
. Pass-by-reference
. Basic sorting algorithms

5. Technologies Used
. C++
. Standard Library (iostream, iomanip)
